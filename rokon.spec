# Empty %files file /builddir/build/BUILD/Rokon-master/debugsourcefiles.list
# Previously, this failed on Mageia only. However, after moving to Clang for faster compilation across the board, it has failed on
# Fedora Linux as well. Since Fedora Linux is the main target and my development machine, I have decided to disable this due to lack of being able to test it.
# Although this is disappointing, this is in line to what the Go macros already do on Fedora Linux.
